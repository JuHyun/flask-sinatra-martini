title: "Python, Ruby, and Golang: A Web Service Application Comparison"
author: Kyle W. Purdon

After a recent comparison of python, ruby, and golang for a command-line application I decided to use the same pattern to compare building a simple web service. I have selected flask (python), sinatra (ruby), and martini (golang) for this comparison. Yes, there are many other options for web application libraries in each language but I felt these three lend well to comparison.

## Library Overviews

Here is a high-level comparison of the libraries by [stackshare](http://stackshare.io/stackups/martini-vs-flask-vs-sinatra).

### [Flask (Python)](http://flask.pocoo.org/)

> Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions.

For very simple applications such as the one shown in this demo flask is a great choice. The basic flask application is only 7 LOC in a single python source file. The draw of flask over other python web libraries (such as [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/)) is that you can start small and build to a more complex application as needed.

*Hello World*
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

### [Sinatra (Ruby)](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)

> Sinatra is a DSL for quickly creating web applications in Ruby with minimal effort.

Just like flask, sinatra is great for simple applications. The basic sinatra application is only 4 LOC in a single ruby source file. Sinatra is used instead of libraries such as [ruby on rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) for the same reason as flask, you can start very small and build to a more complex application as needed.

*Hello World*
```ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/hi' do
  "Hello World!"
end
```

### [Martini (Golang)](http://martini.codegangsta.io/)

> Martini is a powerful package for quickly writing modular web applications/services in Golang.

Martini comes with a few more batteries included than sinatra or flask but is still very lightweight to start with at only 9 LOC for the basic application. Martini has come under some [criticism](https://stephensearles.com/three-reasons-you-should-not-use-martini/) by the golang community but still has one of the highest rated github projects of any Golang web framework. Some others include [Revel](https://revel.github.io/), [Gin](https://gin-gonic.github.io/gin/), and even the built-in [net/http](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/). The author of Martini responded directly to the criticism [here](http://codegangsta.io/blog/2014/05/19/my-thoughts-on-martini/).

*Hello World*
```go
package main

import "github.com/go-martini/martini"

func main() {
  m := martini.Classic()
  m.Get("/", func() string {
    return "Hello world!"
  })
  m.Run()
}
```

## Service Description

The service created provides a very basic blog application. The following routes are constructed:

* `GET /`: Return the blog (using a template to render).
* `GET /json`: Return the blog content in JSON format.
* `POST /new`: Add a new post (title, summary, content) to the blog.

The external interface to the blog service is exactly the same for each language.

### Add A Post

`POST /new`

```sh
curl --form title='Test Post 1' \
     --form summary='The First Test Post' \
     --form content='Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur ...' \
     http://[IP]:[PORT]/new
```

### View The HTML

`GET /`

![blog preview png]({{root_url}}/images/blog.png)

### View The JSON

`GET /json`

```javascript
[
   {
      content:"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur ...",
      title:"Test Post 1",
      _id:{
         $oid:"558329927315660001550970"
      },
      summary:"The First Test Post"
   }
]
```

## Application Structure

Each application can be broken down into the following components:

### Application Setup

* Initialize an application
* Run the application

## Request

* Define routes on which a user can request data (GET)
* Define routes on which a user can submit data (POST)

### Response

* Render JSON (`GET /json`)
* Render a template (`GET /`)

### Database

* Initialize a connection
* Insert data
* Retrieve data

### Application Deployment

* Docker!

<hr>

**The rest of this article will compare each of these components for each library.** The purpose is not to suggest that one of these libraries is better than the other - it is to provide a specific comparison between the three tools:

* [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) (Python)
* [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) (Ruby)
* [martini](http://martini.codegangsta.io/) (Golang)


## Project Setup

All of the projects are bootstrapped using [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Before diving into how each application is bootstrapped under the hood we can just use docker to get each up and running in exactly the same way:

1. `docker-compose up`

Seriously, that's it! Now for each application there is a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` that specify what happens when you run the above command.

### Python (flask) - *Dockerfile*

```
FROM python:2.7

ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This `Dockerfile` says that we are starting from a base image with python 2.7 installed, adding our application to the `/app` directory and using [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install our application requirements specified in `requirements.txt`.

### Ruby (sinatra)

```
FROM ruby:2.2

ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN bundle install
```

This `Dockerfile` says that we are starting from a base image with ruby 2.2 installed, adding our application to the `/app` directory and using [bundler](http://bundler.io/) to install our application requirements specified in the `Gemfile`.

### Golang (martini)

```
FROM golang:1.3

ADD . /go/src/github.com/kpurdon/go-blog
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/kpurdon/go-blog

RUN go get github.com/go-martini/martini && \
    go get github.com/martini-contrib/render && \
    go get gopkg.in/mgo.v2 && \
    go get github.com/martini-contrib/binding
```

This `Dockerfile` says that we are starting from a base image with Golang 1.3 installed, adding our application to the `/go/src/github.com/kpurdon/go-blog` directory and getting all of our necessary dependencies using the `go get` command.

## Initialize/Run An Application

### Python (flask) - *app.py*

```python
# initialize application
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

# run application
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

```sh
$ python app.py
```

### Ruby (sinatra) - *app.rb*

```ruby
# initialize application
require 'sinatra'
```

```sh
$ ruby app.rb
```

### Golang (martini) - *app.go*

```go
// initialize application
package main
import "github.com/go-martini/martini"
import "github.com/martini-contrib/render"

func main() {

    app := martini.Classic()
    app.Use(render.Renderer())

    // run application
    app.Run()

}
```

```sh
$ go run app.go
```

## Define A Route (GET/POST)

### Python (flask)

```python
# get
@app.route('/')
def blog():
    ...

#post
@app.route('/new', methods=['POST'])
def new():
    ...
```

### Ruby (sinatra)

```ruby
# get
get '/' do
  ...
end

# post
post '/new' do
  ...
end
```

### Golang (martini)

```go
// define data struct
type Post struct {
	Title   string `form:"title" json:"title"`
	Summary string `form:"summary" json:"summary"`
	Content string `form:"content" json:"content"`
}

// get
app.Get("/", func(r render.Render) {
	...
}

// post
import "github.com/martini-contrib/binding"
app.Post("/new", binding.Bind(Post{}), func(r render.Render, post Post) {
	...
}
```

## Render A JSON Response

### Python (flask)

Flask provides a [jsonify](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/api/#flask.json.jsonify) method but since the service is using mongodb the mongodb bson utility is used.

```python
from bson.json_util import dumps
return dumps(posts) # posts is a list of dicts [{}, {}]
```

### Ruby (sinatra)

```ruby
require 'json'
content_type :json
posts.to_json # posts is an array (from mongodb)
```

### Golang (martini)

```go
r.JSON(200, posts) // posts is an array of Post{} structs
```

## Render An HTML Response (Templating)

### Python (flask)

```python
return render_template('blog.html', posts=posts)
```


```html
<!doctype HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Python Flask Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>{% raw %}
    {% for post in posts %}
      <h1> {{ post.title }} </h1>
      <h3> {{ post.summary }} </h3>
      <p> {{ post.content }} </p>
      <hr>
    {% endfor %}
  {% endraw %}</body>
</html>
```

### Ruby (sinatra)

```ruby
erb :blog
```

```html
<!doctype HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Ruby Sinatra Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <% @posts.each do |post| %>
      <h1><%= post['title'] %></h1>
      <h3><%= post['summary'] %></h3>
      <p><%= post['content'] %></p>
      <hr>
    <% end %>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Golang (martini)

```go
r.HTML(200, "blog", posts)
```

```html
<!doctype HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Golang Martini Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>{% raw %}
    {{range . }}
      <h1>{{.Title}}</h1>
      <h3>{{.Summary}}</h3>
      <p>{{.Content}}</p>
      <hr>
    {{ end }}
  {% endraw %}</body>
</html>
```

## Database Connection

All of the applications are using the mongodb driver. The environment variable `DB_PORT_27017_TCP_ADDR` is the IP of a linked docker container (the database ip).

### Python (flask)

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
client = MongoClient(os.environ['DB_PORT_27017_TCP_ADDR'], 27017)
db = client.blog
```

### Ruby (sinatra)

```ruby
require 'mongo'
db_ip = [ENV['DB_PORT_27017_TCP_ADDR']]
client = Mongo::Client.new(db_ip, database: 'blog')
```

### Golang (martini)

```go
import "gopkg.in/mgo.v2"
session, _ := mgo.Dial(os.Getenv("DB_PORT_27017_TCP_ADDR"))
db := session.DB("blog")
defer session.Close()
```

## Insert Data From a POST

### Python (flask)

```python
from flask import request
post = {
    'title': request.form['title'],
    'summary': request.form['summary'],
    'content': request.form['content']
}
db.blog.insert_one(post)
```

### Ruby (sinatra)

```ruby
client[:posts].insert_one(params) # params is a hash generated by sinatra
```

### Golang (martini)

```go
db.C("posts").Insert(post) // post is an instance of the Post{} struct
```

## Retrieve Data

### Python (flask)

```python
_posts = db.blog.find()
posts = [post for post in _posts]
```

### Ruby (sinatra)

```ruby
@posts = client[:posts].find.to_a
```

### Golang (martini)

```go
var posts []Post
db.C("posts").Find(nil).All(&posts)
```

## Application Deployment (Docker!)

A great solution to deploying all of these applications is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

### Python (flask)

**Dockerfile**

```
FROM python:2.7

ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
web:
  build: .
  command: python -u app.py
  ports:
    - "5000:5000"
  volumes:
    - .:/app
  links:
    - db
db:
  image: mongo:3.0.4
  command: mongod --quiet --logpath=/dev/null
```

### Ruby (sinatra)

**Dockerfile**

```
FROM ruby:2.2

ADD . /app
WORKDIR /app

RUN bundle install
```

**docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
web:
  build: .
  command: bundle exec ruby app.rb
  ports:
    - "4567:4567"
  volumes:
    - .:/app
  links:
    - db
db:
  image: mongo:3.0.4
  command: mongod --quiet --logpath=/dev/null
```

### Golang (martini)

**Dockerfile**

```
FROM golang:1.3

ADD . /go/src/github.com/kpurdon/go-todo
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/kpurdon/go-todo

RUN go get github.com/go-martini/martini && go get github.com/martini-contrib/render && go get gopkg.in/mgo.v2 && go get github.com/martini-contrib/binding
```

**docker-compose.yml**

```yaml
web:
  build: .
  command: go run app.go
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
  volumes: # look into volumes v. "ADD"
    - .:/go/src/github.com/kpurdon/go-todo
  links:
    - db
db:
  image: mongo:3.0.4
  command: mongod --quiet --logpath=/dev/null
```

## Conclusion

Golang feels like a heavy choice for this type of application unless high performance is a key requirement. Ruby and Python are likely going to be the better choice of language. Python and Ruby (flask and sintra) are very similar as far as this application goes.

Here are a few notable differences:

### Simplicity

While flask is very lightweight and reads clearly the sinatra app is the simplest of the two. At 23 LOC (compared to 46 for flask and 42 for martini). Also the handling of input forms is handled behind the scenes in sinatra. For these reasons sinatra is the winner in this category.

### Documentation

The flask documentation was the simplest to search and most approachable. While the sinatra and martini documentation is complete it was not as approachable. For this reason flask is the winner in this category.

## Final Determination

The correct tool for this example is a tie between Python and Ruby. Pick whichever you are more comfortable with and you will be successful. If you need high performance consider Golang.
